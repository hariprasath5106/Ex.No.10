# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 12-11-25
## Reg. No. 212223060265

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

🧩 Prompt Patterns Introduced
Prompt Pattern	Description	Example Use
Query Decomposition	Break a complex query into smaller, actionable sub-prompts.	“List renewable sources → explain each → compare effectiveness.”
Decision Making	Ask the model to choose a direction or idea.	“Pick the most promising renewable energy source and justify it.”
Answer Engineering	Structure or format the output precisely.	“Write a report with sections: Introduction, Analysis, Conclusion.”
Fact Checklist	Ensure factual accuracy.	“Provide 3 verified facts with citations on solar energy.”
Tail Generation	Extend ideas logically to deepen content.	“Continue the story showing the scientist’s next invention.”
Menu Actions	Provide action choices to guide the AI.	“(1) Write intro (2) Add case study (3) Summarize — choose best next step.”
Semantic Filter	Control tone, accuracy, or style.	“Rewrite this in a professional, concise business tone.”

🧠 Selected Content Scenarios
We’ll demonstrate two scenarios:

Educational Report on Renewable Energy (Structured + Factual)

Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story (Narrative + Imaginative)

🧱 Stage 1: Basic Prompt (Raw Generation)
🧩 Example 1: Educational Report

Prompt:

“Write a report on renewable energy.”

Output (Basic):

Renewable energy comes from natural sources like sunlight, wind, and water. It is important because it helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gases. There are many types like solar, wind, and hydro power.

✅ Simple but lacks structure, analysis, and professional tone.

🧩 Example 2: Sci-Fi Story

Prompt:

“Write a short sci-fi story about robots and humans.”

Output (Basic):

In the future, robots live with humans. One robot named X-9 becomes self-aware and helps humans save Earth from pollution.

✅ Good concept, but lacks depth, emotion, and plot structure.

🚀 Stage 2: Query Decomposition + Answer Engineering

Now, we refine the prompts for structure and clarity.

⚙️ Educational Report (Refined)

Prompt:

“Write a 3-section educational report on renewable energy with:
1️⃣ Introduction
2️⃣ Types of Renewable Energy
3️⃣ Benefits and Future Scope.”

Output:

Introduction:
Renewable energy refers to power derived from resources that naturally replenish, such as sunlight, wind, and water.

Types:

Solar Power: Uses photovoltaic cells.

Wind Power: Converts wind into electricity via turbines.

Hydropower: Generates electricity from moving water.

Benefits & Future:
Renewable energy reduces carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Innovations in energy storage and smart grids are improving efficiency and adoption.

✅ Better structure and educational tone achieved.

⚙️ Sci-Fi Story (Refined)

Prompt:

“Write a 3-paragraph sci-fi short story set in 2120 about a human-robot alliance that prevents a global catastrophe. End with a moral message.”

Output:

In 2120, the Earth’s magnetic field began to collapse. Human engineers and sentient robots worked together to stabilize the planet’s core.

A young scientist, Lira, and her robotic companion, K-7, discovered that cooperation between intelligence and emotion could save humanity.

The world survived — proving that unity between man and machine leads not to domination, but evolution.

✅ Structured storytelling with clear message and flow.

⚖️ Stage 3: Decision Making + Semantic Filtering
🧩 Educational Report – Decision Prompt

Prompt:

“Choose the most promising renewable energy for India between solar, wind, and hydro — justify your choice with facts, benefits, and challenges. Write in a formal academic tone.”

Output:

Chosen Source: Solar Energy
India receives over 300 sunny days annually, making solar energy the most viable renewable source.
Benefits: Abundant sunlight, scalability, and declining photovoltaic costs.
Challenges: Energy storage and land requirements.
Conclusion: Continued investment in solar parks and microgrid systems can ensure sustainable growth.

✅ Uses reasoning, facts, and professional tone — demonstrates Decision Making and Semantic Filtering.

🧩 Sci-Fi Story – Tone Filtered

Prompt:

“Rewrite the same story in a cinematic, suspenseful tone as if for a movie script.”

Output:

Darkness fell over a trembling Earth. The magnetic poles flickered like dying stars.

Lira (whispering): “If we fail, the planet dies.”

K-7’s metallic eyes glowed. “Then let logic and heart unite.”

They activated the core stabilizer — the screen faded to white as Earth breathed again.

✅ Tone successfully adjusted using semantic filtering.

🧩 Stage 4: Tail Generation (Depth Extension)

Prompt:

“Extend the renewable energy report with a future prediction section describing how AI and IoT will transform energy management in the next decade.”

Output:

Future Prediction:
AI-driven smart grids and IoT-enabled monitoring systems will optimize power usage in real-time. Predictive analytics will balance load demand, minimize waste, and improve storage efficiency.
By 2035, decentralized energy systems will empower households to produce and share energy seamlessly.

✅ Demonstrates logical content extension using Tail Generation.

🔍 Stage 5: Fact Checklist Verification

Prompt:

“List 3 verified facts about renewable energy adoption worldwide with sources.”

Output:

As of 2024, renewable sources supply 30% of global electricity (IEA, 2024).

China leads in solar capacity with over 400 GW installed (World Energy Council).

India’s solar capacity surpassed 70 GW as of 2024 (MNRE Report, Govt. of India).

✅ Adds factual accuracy through the Fact Checklist pattern.

📄 Stage 6: Menu Actions (Interactive Refinement)

Prompt:

“We have 3 ways to improve the renewable energy report. Choose the best one and proceed:
1️⃣ Add a global comparison chart.
2️⃣ Add an executive summary.
3️⃣ Add a conclusion with policy recommendations.”

Output:

Choice Selected: 3️⃣ Policy Recommendations

Conclusion:
Governments should incentivize private investments, promote domestic solar manufacturing, and integrate AI-based energy management for nationwide sustainability.

✅ AI made an active decision using the Menu Actions pattern.
